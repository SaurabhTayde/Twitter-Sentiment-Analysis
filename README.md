# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this hands-on project, we will train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from the given dataset.
Dataset is fetched from Kaggle and it consists of thousands of tweets. CSV file has three columns viz. 'id', 'label' and 'tweet'.
The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 

Following steps are covered in the code:

1. Import libraries and datasets 
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Plot the word cloud
4. Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation
5. Perform data cleaning - remove stop words
6. Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)
7. Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization
8. Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers
9. Train a Naive Bayes Classifier
10. Assess trained model performance
